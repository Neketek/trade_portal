# Trade Portal

The "Trade Portal" demonstrates how a Customs Authority may use the
intergov to facilitate exports.

The app uses an external identity provider, to simulate integration
with a national exporter identification scheme. The registration is available to anyone, but admin actions need to be performed so freshly registered users
have required permissions. In the real world the authentication mechanism
will provide all required information.

For detailed technical documentation and development details, see the `DEV.md` file.
