# This file is different only by one external network,
# which assumed to be created by Intergov setup somewhere and used to
# talk to intergov APIs. You don't need it for chambers app UI development,
# or you could configure Intergov api endpoints in a different way
# (cloud setup or so). But if you want to use your local intergov then please
# use it as well.
